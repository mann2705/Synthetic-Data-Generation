This project involves synthetic data generation for healthcare research using a Hierarchical VAE-GAN (Variational Autoencoder - Generative Adversarial Network) model. The model is designed to create synthetic data that mimics real healthcare data distributions without requiring access to real datasets, preserving privacy and enabling research applications in data-limited settings.

Project Structure
The following Python files are included in this project:

data_generation.py:

This file is responsible for generating the synthetic dataset.
It includes functions to create a knowledge graph that defines relationships between diseases and genetic variants, apply semantic rules based on these relationships, and generate synthetic patient data with attributes such as age, gender, genetic variants, disease risks, and clinical results.
The generated data serves as the foundation for training the Hierarchical VAE-GAN model.
models.py:

Defines the Hierarchical VAE-GAN model architecture.
This file contains the neural network architecture, including separate encoders for different types of data (genetic, clinical, environmental), a latent space for feature learning, and a decoder to reconstruct data samples.
It also includes a discriminator network to improve data realism through adversarial training.
utils.py:

Provides utility functions to prepare data for training and to train the Hierarchical VAE-GAN model.
Functions include prepare_data_for_training, which encodes and structures data in batches for training, and train_hierarchical_vaegan, which handles the training process, including calculating losses and updating model weights.
These utilities support the main workflow by streamlining data preparation and model training.
evaluationmetrics.py:

Contains functions to evaluate the quality and realism of the synthetic data generated by the model.
Includes three main evaluation metrics:
Distributional Consistency: Compares statistical moments (mean, variance, skewness) of real and synthetic data to ensure similarity.
Statistical Tests: Uses Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) and T-tests to check distributional alignment between real and synthetic data.
Qualitative Assessment: Provides histograms and box plots to visually compare data distributions, allowing for an intuitive assessment of data quality.
This file is crucial for validating the synthetic data and ensuring it aligns closely with real-world healthcare data distributions.
main.py:

The main application file that ties together the synthetic data generation, model training, and evaluation workflow using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.
Users can specify data generation parameters (such as sample size and selected diseases), initiate data generation, visualize the generated data, and download it in CSV or Excel format.
It also allows users to train a model on the generated data and evaluate the synthetic dataset through the evaluation metrics defined in evaluationmetrics.py.
visualisation.py:

Handles additional data visualization tasks to provide insights into model performance and synthetic data quality.
This file could include functions to generate visualizations like line plots for model accuracy, loss curves, and comparisons across different models (e.g., VAE, GAN, and Hierarchical VAE-GAN).
These visualizations aid in understanding model training progress and evaluating synthetic data quality over time.
Usage
Generate Synthetic Data: Use the interface in main.py to specify parameters for data generation. This will create synthetic healthcare data based on the relationships defined in the knowledge graph.
Train Model: Optionally, train a Hierarchical VAE-GAN model on the synthetic data using the training functionality provided in main.py.
Evaluate Synthetic Data: Run evaluationmetrics.py to assess the quality and distributional consistency of the generated data, ensuring it meets the standards for realistic healthcare data.
Visualize Results: Use visualisation.py to generate plots and visual comparisons, helping you analyze model performance and synthetic data realism.
